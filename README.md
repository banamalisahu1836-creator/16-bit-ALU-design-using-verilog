# 16-bit alu design
<br>
16-bit arithmetic logic unit designed using the Verilog in Vivado tool.
<br>
A 16-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) performs arithmetic, logical, and shift operations on two 16-bit inputs. 
<br>
Operations of a 16-Bit ALU such as
Addition (A + B)
Subtraction (A − B)
Multiplication (A*B)
Increment (A + 1)
Decrement (A − 1)
AND (A & B)
OR (A | B)
XOR (A ⊕ B)
XNOR ~(A ⊕ B)
NOT (~A)
Logical Left Shift (A << 1)
Logical Right Shift (A >> 1)
